Tool to review GRE practice exams. Converting Images into data tables, and performing simple analysis

Kaplan offers services to aid users pursuing graduate programs require the submission GRE scores. While the site provides feedback on individual quizzes by showing users areas of strength and weakness, it does not have any way to view the accumlation of data containing the result of all quizzes taken. 

I began to implement a tool that uses screen shots, of the results of individual quizzes, to compile a summary of the results over all imported quizzes.
